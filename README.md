# Khanaqin Font
by Abbas Majeed

"Khanaqin" is a sans serif Font. It was first designed in 1997 and has been published as a single weight Font under the name "Ali_k_Khanaqin". The new Khanaqin Font is a redesign of the old font with support for Arabic / Kurdish / Persian / Urdu languages.

The name "Khanaqin" is the name of a small town which has an old bridge with beautiful arches, which inspired me to design this font.
